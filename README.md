# Face Recognition Attendance System
This project implements a face recognition-based attendance system using Python, OpenCV, and machine learning techniques. 
The system captures and recognizes faces in real-time, marking attendance in a CSV file. 
This project is suitable for classroom or office environments where automatic attendance tracking is beneficial.
# Features
Real-time Face Detection: Utilizes OpenCV's Haar Cascades to detect faces in a video stream.
Face Recognition: Identifies known faces using pre-trained models and marks attendance.
CSV Export: Automatically logs attendance in a CSV file with timestamps.
Data Persistence: Stores face encodings and names for future recognition.
Simple and Intuitive Interface: Easy-to-use interface with clear instructions for capturing and recognizing faces.
